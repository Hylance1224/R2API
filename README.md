## üìÅ Repository Structure

*   `R2API/`\
    The core implementation of the R2API method, which applies Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) combined with multi-task learning for web API recommendation.

    *   `Original Dataset/`\
        Contains data collected from ProgrammableWeb, including Mashup-API interactions, textual descriptions, and other metadata used in our experiments.

*   `Baseline method/`\
    Implementations or scripts for the baseline methods used for comparison with R2API.

*   `Github data/`\
    Additional mashup data collected from GitHub.
