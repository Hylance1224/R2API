# R2API: A novel method for web API recommendation by using HGNNs with multi-task learning

This repository contains the dataset and source code for the paper:\
**"R2API: A Novel Method for Web API Recommendation Using HGNNs with Multi-task Learning"**

## 1. R2API

### 1.1 Environment Setup

Our code has been tested under **Python 3.12.3**, and the following packages are required:

    h5py==3.11.0 
    scikit_learn==1.4.2 
    sentence_transformers==2.7.0 
    torch==2.7.0+cu126

We recommend setting up the environment using **Conda** to ensure compatibility and ease of installation.

#### ✅ Step 1: Create and activate a new Conda environment

    conda create -n R2API python=3.12.3 -y
    conda activate R2API 

#### ✅ Step 2: Install the required Python packages

Install all dependencies (except PyTorch) via `requirements.txt`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

> ⚠️ Note: The `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary libraries **except for PyTorch**, which should be installed separately to match your system and CUDA version.

#### ✅ Step 3: Install PyTorch manually

Visit the official PyTorch installation page to choose the correct version for your environment.\
For example, to install **PyTorch with CUDA 12.6**, use:

    pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

### 1.2 Usage

#### ✅ Step 1: Data generation (Optional)

> This step can be skipped, as all required training and testing files have already been generated in advance. However, if you intend to apply the method to a new dataset, you may execute the following script.

To generate the dataset, start Python in **command line** mode and run:

    python generate_dataset.py

This script uses the original files `Original Dataset/programmable_mashup.json` and `Original Dataset/api.json` as input and performs the following operations:

*   Generates **10-fold cross-validation data**  under the `dataset` folder.

*   Creates a `data` folder containing:

    *   `API_vectors.h5` and `vectors.h5`: Sentence embedding vectors for API and mashup descriptions.

    *   `api_tag_vector.h5` and `mashup_tag_vector.h5`: Embedding vectors for API and mashup tags.

Each directory under the `dataset` folder  (`fold_1` to `fold_10`) contains the following files:

*   `RS.csv`: Test set of mashup–API pairs.

*   `TE.csv`: Training set of mashup–API pairs.

*   `api_tags.csv`, `Api_tag_mapping.csv`: API–tag relationships and tag–index mappings.

*   `mashup_tags.csv`, `mashup_tag_mapping.csv`: Mashup–tag relationships and tag–index mappings.

#### ✅ Step 2: **Model Training and Testing and Evaluation metrics**

The provided wrapper script `run.py` is designed to **automate the entire experimental pipeline**, including:

*   Sequential training and testing on all **10 folds** of the dataset

*   Printing **per-fold evaluation metrics** after each run

*   Computing and printing the **overall performance across all folds**

✅ **If you use the Conda, ensure that the Conda environment is activated before running the script:**

    conda activate R2API

To train and test the model, start Python in **command line** mode and execute the following (in one line):

    python run.py

After execution, the results will be saved in the `output` folder, which includes recommendation results for the **10-fold dataset**.

&#x20;

After each fold is completed, the corresponding evaluation metrics will be printed to the terminal in the following format:

    The performance of fold_1 is as follows: 
    N=3 -> Precision: 0.3111, Recall: 0.6639, MAP: 0.7231, NDCG: 0.6675, Cov: 0.1798 
    N=5 -> Precision: 0.2022, Recall: 0.7088, MAP: 0.7249, NDCG: 0.6823, Cov: 0.2585 
    N=10 -> Precision: 0.1116, Recall: 0.7593, MAP: 0.7157, NDCG: 0.7007, Cov: 0.4032 
    N=20 -> Precision: 0.0598, Recall: 0.7975, MAP: 0.7071, NDCG: 0.7123, Cov: 0.5883

These results reflect the model's performance on **fold\_1**.

**⚠️** After all 10 folds of the programmable dataset are completed, the script will automatically display the **overall evaluation results across all folds**, using the same format as above.
