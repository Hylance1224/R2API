However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.\nStill, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs.",

When the three minutes are up, users are asked if they would like to continue the conversation. If both users say \"yes\", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want. But if someone says \"no\", the connection is closed and both people go their separate ways. No hurt feelings, no need to \"let her down easily\" and no awkward, half-hug on your doorstep.",
