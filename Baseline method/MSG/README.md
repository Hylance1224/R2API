## **üîß Supplementary Instructions (added by Yihui Wang**üë©‚Äçüíª)

The following section provides additional guidance for setting up and running the project.

### 1. Python Version Requirements and Dependency Installation

&#x20;

**Python 3.8.0 environment**\
Required to run data generation and semantic-related scripts.\
Install dependencies with the following command:

    pip install -r requirements_python38.txt

**Python 3.7.0 environment**\
Used for training the recommendation model.\
Install dependencies with the following command:

    pip install -r requirements_python37.txt

### 2. Running Steps

Please use the matching Python version to run the corresponding scripts. Examples (modify the paths according to your Python installation):

1.  **Data Generation (Python 3.8):**

<!---->

    python generate_data.py

1.  **file downloading and unzip**

**Download** the file from:\
<http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip>

**Unzip** it and place the file `glove.6B.200d.txt` into the folder named `.vec_cache` under the project root.



1.  **Semantic Processing Scripts (Python 3.8):**

<!---->

    python retrieve/bert_whitening.py
    python retrieve/Semantic.py

1.  **Train Recommendation Model (Python 3.7):**

<!---->

    python train_recommder_api.py

### 3. Notes

**Virtual Environment Recommended**\
It is recommended to create separate virtual environments for Python 3.7 and Python 3.8 to isolate dependencies and avoid version conflicts.\
You can use `venv` or `conda` to create virtual environments.
